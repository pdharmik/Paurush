<p><span style="font-size: larger">&nbsp;<strong><u>General Service Portal Questions</u></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><a name="Q1">Q: What do I do if the site goes down?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The LGS Portal is continually monitored for availability, so in the event the site is down, Lexmark is likely already working on the issue. &nbsp;If you try again in a few minutes, the problem should be resolved. &nbsp;Occasionally the site may be down on a weekend for scheduled maintenance, but will be restored as quickly as possible. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Q2"><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What Browsers are supported?</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;The LGS Portal utilizes many advanced web features, and supports most available current browsers. &nbsp;This includes the IE family of browsers, from IE6 to IE8, recent versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. &nbsp;Naturally, you will have the best experience from the most current version of your favorite browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q3">Q: How do I change my personal information, such as address or password?</a></strong></p>
<p>Any user may edit&nbsp;his or her&nbsp;profile preferences by selecting the "Preferences" link located in the top right corner of the site. &nbsp;This includes your name, email address, password, preferred language, and other key information.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q4">Q: How do&nbsp;I contact someone if I need help?&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Contact information is located in the "Contact Lexmark" link located in the top right corner of the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger"><u><strong>Questions about Service Portal Access</strong></u></span></p>
<p><strong><a name="Q5">Q: How do I get access?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are reading this, you likely already have access. &nbsp;But should you require a higher level of access, or have a question about your ID, you can contact the appropriate person listed on the "Contact Lexmark" page, found by clicking on the link in the top right of your screen.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q6">Q: Why do user IDs show different results?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The LGS Portal is specifically tailored to provide you with the tools you need based on your role within your company. &nbsp;Users may have varying features based on the roles assigned to their user ID, and users may see differences in the number of service requests, devices, etc. based on how much of the company they are allowed to see. &nbsp;If you feel you need additional roles, or visibility to more of the company, please contact your company's administrator.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q7">Q: Where can I get the shared key?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Your administrator should be able to provide you with the shared key, which allows you to register for access to the Portal. &nbsp;They may include a link to register on your company intranet, which automatically passes the shared key to you, or you may need to request the key from your administrator.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q8">Q: How do I know if I have the correct view?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;If something feels "off" about your level of access, reach out to your company administrator. &nbsp;They can confirm that you have the correct access to utilize the LGS Portal to its full potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger"><u><strong>Questions about Service Portal Terminology</strong></u></span></p>
<p><strong><a name="Q9">Q: I need help with some of the terminology displayed in the Portal. </a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Serial Number</strong>: &nbsp;A serial number is a unique, identifying number assigned to an individual piece of hardware or software. &nbsp;You can usually find the serial number on a bar-coded label on your device.</p>
<p><strong>Product Model</strong>: The product model denotes the particular family of device that you have and is helpful in communicating to others your device and its capabilities when requesting support, consumables, accessories, or software. &nbsp;The product model is usually listed on the front of your device.</p>
<p><strong>Asset Tag</strong>: &nbsp;Assigned by Lexmark, the asset tag contains a unique number and corresponding barcode and can contain customized information regarding the customer installation. &nbsp;It usually links a device to Lexmark's asset management software for tracking purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Device Tag</strong>: &nbsp;Assigned by the customer, the customer device tag contains a unique number and potentially a corresponding barcode and can contain customized information regarding the customer installation. &nbsp;It usually links a device to the company's fixed asset register for tracking purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Device Hostname</strong>: &nbsp;A hostname is the nickname that is given to a device connected to a computer network. &nbsp;A hostname can be used to easily look up the IP address of a device on the network. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IP Address</strong>: &nbsp;An IP address is a unique number that every computer or device connected to the internet is assigned. &nbsp;Much like a telephone number, the IP address allows computers and devices to talk to one another on the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q10">Q: What is a Customer Hierarchy Level (CHL)?</a></strong></p>
<p>The customer hierarchy is a customized tree structure that helps you find your devices and transaction history in a way that makes sense to your company. &nbsp;Lexmark works with your account managers to define how your company would like to organize its devices. &nbsp;This could be by geographic location, department name or number, cost center, business function, etc. &nbsp;Once established, the customer hierarchy makes navigating your portal and reports much easier. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q11">Q: What is a bookmarked device?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;If you frequently work with specific devices (on your floor, in your building or store, etc.), you can easily bookmark those devices once you have located them in the Portal. &nbsp;Simply click the star "Bookmark this Device" from the device listing. &nbsp;Once the device is bookmarked, you can easily filter the list to just these important devices using the "Bookmarked Devices" filter on the left navigation menu of many screens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger; "><u><strong>Page and Function-Specific Service Portal Questions</strong></u></span><u><strong> </strong></u></p>
<p><strong><a name="Q12">Q: What do I do if information is missing?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Portal reflects the current information on file for your account; however there are some circumstances where the information may appear to be missing. &nbsp;The amount of data available for your devices may vary depending on the level of service you have contracted from Lexmark. &nbsp;Some contracts will only include very basic device information, while other contracts include more rich information, included as part of your managed print services agreement with Lexmark. &nbsp;Additionally, new devices or recently moved or exchanged devices may require a few days to reflect the correct information. If you feel there is a problem with the information listed for your device, you can find help by clicking the "Contact Lexmark" link located in the top right of the screen.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q13">Q: What do I do if a Portal function is not working properly? </a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;If a Portal function does not appear to be working correctly, first ensure you have a reliable internet connection. &nbsp;The Portal requires a consistent connection to the internet to deliver search results and other key information dynamically. &nbsp;If you are still experiencing issues, confirm that your browser is supported for use with the LGS Portal. &nbsp;These supported browsers can be found in the FAQ section. &nbsp;If this still has not resolved your issue, please try again in a few minutes as the issue may be temporary, or a Lexmark technician may already be working to resolve the issue. &nbsp;Lastly, if you are still having trouble with the Portal, you can find help by clicking the "Contact Lexmark" link located in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q14">Q: What do I do if my report doesn't run as scheduled?</a> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;If for some reason your report was not delivered on schedule, it may still be in the process of generating. &nbsp;On occasion, the number of reports requested may cause a temporary backlog and your report will arrive as quickly as possible. &nbsp;If you are still having trouble receiving your report, you can find help by clicking on the "Contact Lexmark" link located in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q15">Q: How do I understand what a report means? </a></strong></p>
<p>The available reports provide a rich set of information about your device fleet and as such can occasionally require some additional assistance to understand the fields and data elements provided. &nbsp;If you find yourself requiring a little help, please contact your account team (found in the "Contact Lexmark" link) for assistance. &nbsp;We're happy to help!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="Q16">Q: What is a notification?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Notifications may appear from time to time on your homepage that allow Lexmark to communicate important news and alerts to you when you access the Portal. &nbsp;These may reference new features made available to you, new training tools you may want to take advantage of, or simply planned system maintenance alerts so you know when scheduled maintenance is occurring. &nbsp;You can dismiss notifications once you have read them so they are no longer intruding on your homepage.</p>
